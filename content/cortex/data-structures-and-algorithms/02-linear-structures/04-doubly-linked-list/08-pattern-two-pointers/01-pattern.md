title: "Pattern: Two Pointers"
summary: "Converge two pointers from the head and the tail, walking inward. A doubly list's prev pointer makes the right pointer's leftward step O(1) — the same converging scan that's impractical on a singly list. Powers two-sum, palindrome checks, and sorted-pair search."

# Pattern: Two Pointers

## Why It Exists

The converging two-pointer scan — one pointer from the front, one from the back, both walking inward — is a workhorse on arrays: "find two sorted values that sum to a target," "is this a palindrome?" The natural question is whether a linked list can do the same.

A **singly** list can't, not efficiently. The right pointer has to move *leftward*, but a singly node has no link back — to step `right` one position left you'd re-walk from the head to find its predecessor, turning each step into `O(n)` and the whole scan into `O(n²)`. A **doubly** list removes exactly that obstacle: every node carries a `prev` pointer, so `right = right.prev` is a single `O(1)` hop. The pattern that's impractical on a singly list is natural here — it's the clearest payoff of the backward pointer.

## See It Work

On a **sorted** doubly list `1 ⇄ 2 ⇄ 4 ⇄ 7 ⇄ 11 ⇄ 15`, find two values that sum to `15`. Start wide (head + tail) and squeeze inward. Run it, then **Visualise** the two pointers converge.

> ▶ Run it, then click **Visualise** — `left` starts at the head, `right` at the tail; too-small a sum advances `left`, too-large retreats `right` (one `prev` hop).

```python run viz=linked-list viz-root=head viz-kind=list-double
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

vals = [1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 15]                  # sorted doubly list
nodes = [Node(v) for v in vals]
for i in range(len(nodes) - 1):
    nodes[i].next = nodes[i + 1]; nodes[i + 1].prev = nodes[i]
head = nodes[0]

left = head
right = nodes[-1]                            # the tail
target = 15
answer = None
while left is not right:
    s = left.val + right.val
    if s == target:
        answer = (left.val, right.val); break
    elif s < target:
        left = left.next                     # need a bigger sum → move left rightward
    else:
        right = right.prev                   # need a smaller sum → move right leftward (O(1))
print(answer)                                # (4, 11)
```

## How It Works

`left` starts at the head, `right` at the tail. The list is **sorted**, so the sum `left.val + right.val` reacts predictably to each move: advancing `left` (`left.next`) can only *raise* the sum; retreating `right` (`right.prev`) can only *lower* it. So:

- `sum < target` → the sum is too small → `left = left.next`.
- `sum > target` → too large → `right = right.prev`.
- `sum == target` → found.

Each step eliminates one value that can't be part of any solution, and the pointers march toward each other until they meet.

  I["left = head; right = tail"] --> Q{"left ≠ right?"}
  Q -->|"yes"| C{"left.val + right.val vs target"}

  C -->|"== target"| F(["found the pair"])
  L --> Q
  R --> Q
  Q -->|"no — crossed"| N(["no pair"])
```

<p align="center"><strong>converge from both ends: compare the sum to the target, advance <code>left</code> if too small, retreat <code>right</code> if too large, stop when they meet or match.</strong></p>

The entire scan is **`O(n)` time, `O(1)` space** — but only because `right.prev` is `O(1)`. That single fact is the whole reason this pattern lives in the doubly-list chapter and not the singly one. (It also needs the **tail**; a doubly list that tracks its tail hands you the right pointer's start for free.)

### Key Takeaway

Converge `left` from the head and `right` from the tail on a sorted doubly list: too-small a sum advances `left`, too-large retreats `right` (`prev`), a match wins. `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space — and it's the `O(1)` backward `prev` step that makes the scan possible at all.

## Trace It

Target `15` on `1 ⇄ 2 ⇄ 4 ⇄ 7 ⇄ 11 ⇄ 15`:

| `left` | `right` | sum | vs 15 | move |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `1` | `15` | 16 | `>` | `right = 11` |
| `1` | `11` | 12 | `<` | `left = 2` |
| `2` | `11` | 13 | `<` | `left = 4` |
| `4` | `11` | 15 | `=` | **found (4, 11)** |

Before you read on: at the very first step the sum `16` was too big, so we moved `right` from `15` to `11` via `right.prev`. On a *singly* list, how expensive would that one backward step have been — and what would it do to the whole scan?

On a singly list there's no `prev`, so finding the node before `15` means walking from the head again — `O(n)` for that *single* step. Do that on every "retreat right," and the `O(n)` scan balloons to `O(n²)`, erasing the advantage over just checking all pairs. The doubly list's `prev` makes the retreat `O(1)`, which is the only reason the converging scan stays linear. Same algorithm as the array version — it just needed the backward pointer to be viable on a list.

## Your Turn

The reusable sorted two-sum on a doubly list:

```python run
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

def two_sum(head, target):
    left = head
    right = head
    while right.next:                # find the tail
        right = right.next
    while left is not right:
        s = left.val + right.val
        if s == target:
            return (left.val, right.val)
        elif s < target:
            left = left.next
        else:
            right = right.prev       # O(1) backward step
    return None

vals = [1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 15]
nodes = [Node(v) for v in vals]
for i in range(len(nodes) - 1):
    nodes[i].next = nodes[i + 1]; nodes[i + 1].prev = nodes[i]
print(two_sum(nodes[0], 15))         # (4, 11)
```

```java run
public class Main {
  static class Node { int val; Node prev, next; Node(int v){ val = v; } }

  static int[] twoSum(Node head, int target) {
    Node left = head, right = head;
    while (right.next != null) right = right.next;   // find the tail
    while (left != right) {
      int s = left.val + right.val;
      if (s == target) return new int[]{left.val, right.val};
      else if (s < target) left = left.next;
      else right = right.prev;                       // O(1) backward step
    }
    return null;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] vals = {1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 15};
    Node[] n = new Node[vals.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < vals.length; i++) n[i] = new Node(vals[i]);
    for (int i = 0; i < vals.length - 1; i++) { n[i].next = n[i + 1]; n[i + 1].prev = n[i]; }
    int[] r = twoSum(n[0], 15);
    System.out.println(r == null ? "none" : "(" + r[0] + ", " + r[1] + ")");   // (4, 11)
  }
}
```

## Reflect & Connect

The converging scan transfers directly once you have `O(1)` backward movement:

- **The family** — sorted two-sum (above), **palindrome check** (compare `left.val` and `right.val`, step inward), **three-sum** (fix one node, converge the other two over the rest). All are "squeeze from both ends."
- **The `prev` pointer is the enabler** — this is the canonical demonstration of *why* a doubly list exists: it makes backward traversal `O(1)`, which turns an `O(n²)`-on-a-singly-list scan into `O(n)`. When you see "two values from both ends of a sorted sequence," reach for converging pointers.
- **Where each structure stands** — arrays give `O(1)` movement in *both* directions (indices), so they're the most natural home for this pattern; a doubly list matches them for traversal here; a singly list is the odd one out. Same idea from the [array two-pointers](/cortex/data-structures-and-algorithms/linear-structures-arrays-pattern-two-pointers-pattern) pattern, now on links.

## Recall

> **Mnemonic:** *`left` from head, `right` from tail, squeeze inward. Sum too small → `left.next`; too big → `right.prev`. The `O(1)` `prev` hop is what makes it work.*

| | |
|---|---|
| Setup | `left = head`, `right = tail` (sorted list) |
| Too small | `left = left.next` (raise the sum) |
| Too large | `right = right.prev` (lower the sum) — `O(1)` only with `prev` |
| Stop | values match, or pointers meet |
| Cost | `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space |

- **Q:** Why can't a singly list run the converging two-pointer scan efficiently? **A:** Moving `right` leftward needs its predecessor, which costs `O(n)` per step without a `prev` pointer — the scan degrades to `O(n²)`.
- **Q:** On a sorted list, why is moving one pointer always the right call? **A:** Advancing `left` only raises the sum and retreating `right` only lowers it, so each move discards a value that can't be in any solution.
- **Q:** What two things does the pattern require from the list? **A:** Access to the tail (the right pointer's start) and `O(1)` backward movement (`prev`).
- **Q:** How does three-sum build on this? **A:** Fix one node, then converge two pointers over the remaining sorted values.
